# APK scaffolding - Comarca Ventas

Steps to build APK (Expo managed workflow):
1. Install Expo CLI: npm install -g expo-cli
2. From repo root: cd apk_scaffolding
3. Add app code or point to /app
4. expo build:android --type apk (or use EAS build for newer workflow)
5. For Play Store: create keystore and use expo credentials to sign builds.

Note: iOS requires Apple Developer account and macOS to build locally or use EAS.
